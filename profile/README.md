## ✅ What is the Filmora Free Trial?  

The **Filmora free trial** is essentially a limited version of the paid Filmora software. It lets you access most of its core editing tools—like drag-and-drop features, advanced transitions, music, effects, and text animations—without spending a dime.  

However, the trial does have one catch: any videos you export will include a watermark. This is quite common in video editing software trials. The idea is simple—you get to explore everything before upgrading to a paid plan, so you’re making an informed choice.
